- test renaming.  someone said it doesnt work

- test drawterm when no auth is present.. does this work?  how?
  someone has reported that it does.. that also might explain
  what capso was seeing.

- some auth botches should indicate auth failure instead
  to give better error messages.
  ie. when bad user or password causes a bad decrypt...

  - need a clear error when auth server is unreachable or not
    responding appropriately
  - need a clear error when user or password is wrong

- run tests looking for memory leaks and corruption

  memory leak?  I fixed one after this last patch, so possibly
  already fixed?
