- some auth botches should indicate auth failure instead
  to give better error messages.
  ie. when bad user or password causes a bad decrypt...

- readme needs to discuss building libnpauth too
  it should probably mention that you dont need to build some directories
  it should mention how to adjust the path to openssl if necessary
